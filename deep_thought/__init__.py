Stuff to think about

This is mostly to demo how to format stuff properly & what it will look like.

It's based on numpy's readthedocs.io /latest/format.html#docstring-standard.

Variable descriptions.... 
Note: single line return (like so) seem to be ignore. Put a full blank line between sections if you want them to actually show separately.

my_vars : float, optional

They suggest that `my_vars` should be enclosed in backticks.

This will be *italics* and this will be **bold** and ``this will be monospace whatever that means``

This will bring you on `StackOverflow <https://stackoverflow.com/>`_

.. _title: 

=======================
WE CAN ALSO DO SECTIONS
=======================
And we can also do subtitles
-----------------------------

Using definition
    This is pretty useful for long texts/classes/modules/methods. Term to define must be a one-liner. Then tab text below - all of the following paragraphs starting with the tabbed text will be "the definition"



Option lists (see a 2nd subtitle)
---------------------------------
-f  must have at least 2 spaces between the -flag & the description for it to count as such.
--input  I think this look pretty doh.

Simple tables
-------------------------------
Explain logical stuff & summarize:

=====  =====  ======
   Inputs     Output
------------  ------
  A      B    A or B
=====  =====  ======
False  False  False
True   False  True
False  True   True
True   True   True
=====  =====  ======

Internal references
--------------------------
Internal crossreferences, like  how to do title_.
